According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as of 2018, 34.2 million Americans have diabetes, and 88 million people have prediabetes. Additionally, the CDC estimates that 1 in 5 people with diabetes and nearly 8 in 10 people with prediabetes are unaware of their condition. While there are different types of diabetes, type 2 diabetes is the most common, and its prevalence depends on factors such as age, education, income, place of residence, race, and other social determinants of health. The burden of the disease falls more heavily on individuals with lower economic status. Diabetes also imposes a heavy economic burden. The total cost for individuals diagnosed with diabetes is approximately $327 billion, while the overall costs, including undiagnosed individuals and those with prediabetes, are estimated to be around $400 billion annually.

To address this, we aim to develop a system that collects information from users about their health status and reports their risk of developing diabetes. This system will require a model to predict diabetes risk. In this project, we will create this model using the data we have available.
